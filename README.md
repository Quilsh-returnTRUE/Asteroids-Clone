# Asteroids-Clone

Do Not dog me for the look, im too lazy to finish this, all thats left to complete it is custom art like the spaceship and asteroids and im not wasting my time doing that

C++ Asteroid Clone game using SFML to render and draw. 
Made my own collision hitboxes for the player spaceship, asteroids, and bullets
the collision functions are at the top of the main method but most of the other functions are in their respective headers 
This was another side project to keep me busy. Took me a few days to "finish" it
